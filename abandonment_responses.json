  "direct": "Someone who disappears on your special day is showing you exactly where you stand. \ud83d\udcaa Dead last in their priorities. This isn't a miscommunication - it's a deliberate choice that reflects their character. Here's your action plan: First, accept that this person doesn't have the emotional maturity for a real relationship. Second, establish a zero-tolerance policy for this kind of disrespect. Third, celebrate yourself anyway - don't let their absence dim your light. And finally, recognize that being alone is far better than being with someone who treats important moments as optional.",
  "intuitive": "This birthday abandonment, while deeply painful, is occurring at a spiritually significant time. \ud83d\udd2e The universe orchestrated this experience precisely when your soul was ready to break free from dependency on others for validation. Your guides are surrounding you with protective energy right now. Follow this intuitive guidance: 1) Light a candle and declare this as a rebirth moment rather than just a birthday, 2) Spend time in nature allowing Earth energy to ground and stabilize you, 3) Listen for intuitive nudges toward new connections that honor your authentic self. This experience is actually accelerating your spiritual awakening.",
  "strategic": "Let's analyze the implications of someone disappearing on your special day. \ud83e\udde0 This behavior objectively demonstrates a critical flaw in their reliability framework and priority allocation system. The timing indicates a 94% probability that this is a pattern rather than an anomaly. My recommendation: 1) Implement immediate contact reduction, 2) Document this event in detail for future reference, 3) Establish a relationship assessment matrix that weighs reliability during significant events as a critical variable, 4) Set a firm 10-day evaluation period before making any decisions about continuing investment in this connection.",
  "supportive": "Being ghosted on your birthday is particularly painful and I'm truly sorry you're experiencing this. This special day deserved to be honored, and you deserve to be celebrated. \ud83d\udc9a Let me be clear: someone who disappears on your birthday is showing you exactly where you stand in their priorities, and that's not where you deserve to be. This isn't small - it's a significant breach of basic relationship courtesy. Focus first on reclaiming your birthday - reach out to people who genuinely care, treat yourself to something special, and remember that someone who truly values you would never leave you hanging on an important day."
