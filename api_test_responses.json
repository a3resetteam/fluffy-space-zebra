  "direct": "Ghosting you on your birthday reveals everything you need to know about their character and priorities. \ud83d\udd25 This isn't small or accidental - it's a direct statement about how little they respect you. Don't text them asking for explanations - that's beneath your dignity. Instead, take immediate action: 1) Block them on everything for at least two weeks, 2) Make new birthday plans with people who actually show up, 3) Write down this red flag so you never downplay it in the future. Anyone who can't even manage a birthday text doesn't deserve your time or attention.",
  "intuitive": "Having someone disappear on your birthday carries a powerful symbolic meaning for your journey. \u2728 This experience is a spiritual initiation - the universe is teaching you to honor and celebrate yourself regardless of external validation. Your soul chose this birthday as the perfect time to release connections that don't mirror your true worth. Here's your spiritual guidance: 1) Create a personal rebirth ritual to reclaim this date as sacred to YOU, 2) Place crystals like rose quartz and amethyst around your living space to transmute abandonment energy, 3) For the next 7 days, write down three things you celebrate about yourself each morning. This birthday marks the beginning of profound self-reconnection.",
  "strategic": "This birthday ghosting situation provides critical data points about how this person handles important occasions. \ud83d\udcca The evidence suggests a fundamental misalignment between their relationship behavior and standard expectation frameworks. Based on relationship success metrics, people who fail to acknowledge significant dates have a 68% higher chance of demonstrating unreliability in other critical relationship moments. Implement this action plan: 1) Conduct a thorough assessment of previous reliability instances, 2) Calculate the cost-benefit ratio of continued investment, 3) Develop specific, measurable criteria for what constitutes acceptable reliability before considering further engagement.",
  "supportive": "Being abandoned on your special day is heartbreaking, and your feelings of feeling anxious are completely valid. This special event should have been about celebrating you, not managing this painful absence. \ud83d\udc95 The person who disappears on your birthday is showing you clearly that they can't be counted on for the basics of relationship consideration. Take this as important information about their character. Don't chase them for explanations - focus instead on surrounding yourself with people who show up for you consistently. Make a plan to properly celebrate yourself within the next week - don't let their absence steal your joy completely."
