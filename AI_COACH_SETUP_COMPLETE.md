- Monitor usage via OpenAI dashboard
- Consider rate limiting for production use

```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_coach_conversations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    customer_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    coach_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_message TEXT NOT NULL,
    ai_response TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    session_id TEXT
);
```
