ðŸŽ¯ CUSTOM RITUAL CREATOR - COMPLETED FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================

âœ… FIXED: Therapeutic Stretching Sequence Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM: Therapeutic stretching only showed vague categories like "Targeted fascial release techniques" with no specific instructions.

SOLUTION: Added detailed, body-area specific therapeutic stretching sequences including:
- Precise timing (45 seconds, 2 minutes, etc.)
- Specific therapeutic techniques (fascial release, trigger points, neural gliding)
- Professional terminology and progressive difficulty
- Complete coverage for all body areas (neck/shoulders, spine/back, hips/pelvis, core, legs/feet, heart/chest, full body)

âœ… FIXED: Timer Functionality 
-----------------------------
PROBLEM: Timer wasn't working due to JavaScript expecting old HTML structure.

SOLUTION: Completely rewrote JavaScript timer code to:
- Work with new ritual step display structure
- Properly highlight active/completed steps
- Smooth step transitions with auto-scrolling
- Accurate countdown with progress ring updates
- Proper pause/resume functionality

âœ… ENHANCED: Visual Design & UI Polish
--------------------------------------
PROBLEM: Ritual steps weren't properly boxed and looked unclean.

SOLUTION: Enhanced CSS styling with:
- Modern boxed design with gradients and shadows
- Better visual separation between steps
- Enhanced active/completed step highlighting
- Floating emoji animations
- Improved hover effects on focus area tags
- Professional backdrop filters and transitions
- Smooth scaling and positioning animations
