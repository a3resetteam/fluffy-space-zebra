   ```

   Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

3. **Restart the Application**

   Restart the Flask application to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

## Testing the AI Coach

1. Log in to the platform
2. Navigate to the AI Coach page (`/ai-coach`)
3. Select a coach type
4. Start a conversation by typing a message
5. Observe the AI-generated response
6. Test different coach types to experience their unique styles

## Troubleshooting

- **API Errors**: Check your OpenAI API key and network connection
- **Slow Responses**: The AI may take a moment to generate thoughtful responses
- **Page Not Loading**: Ensure the Flask application is running properly

## Notes for Developers

- The AI response system is in `app.py` under `generate_ai_coach_response()`
- Conversation history is stored in the `ai_coach_conversations` table
- Frontend code in `templates/ai-coach.html` handles the UI interactions
- The system has a fallback mechanism if the API fails
