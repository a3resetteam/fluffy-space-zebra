DIRECT COACH RESPONSE:
Someone who disappears on your special day is showing you exactly where you stand. ðŸ’ª Dead last in their priorities. This isn't a miscommunication - it's a deliberate choice that reflects their character. Here's your action plan: First, accept that this person doesn't have the emotional maturity for a real relationship. Second, establish a zero-tolerance policy for this kind of disrespect. Third, celebrate yourself anyway - don't let their absence dim your light. And finally, recognize that being alone is far better than being with someone who treats important moments as optional.
