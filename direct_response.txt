Direct Coach Response:
Ghosting you on your birthday reveals everything you need to know about their character and priorities. ðŸ”¥ This isn't small or accidental - it's a direct statement about how little they respect you. Don't text them asking for explanations - that's beneath your dignity. Instead, take immediate action: 1) Block them on everything for at least two weeks, 2) Make new birthday plans with people who actually show up, 3) Write down this red flag so you never downplay it in the future. Anyone who can't even manage a birthday text doesn't deserve your time or attention.
